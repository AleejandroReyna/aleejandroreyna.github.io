            Knowing Python, Ruby, Javascript and Typescript has made these 12 years of experience wonderful. 
            I'm passionate about technology, best practices, teamwork, and a firm believer that everyone deserves a chance.
            </p>
            <p className="py-2 text-xl">
            I'm interested in leaving a better world for those who follow in our footsteps. I'm a cat lover and musician since I was 14. I'm constantly learning, with solid experience in Django, EcmaScript, 
            React, and React Native, but always open to stepping out of my comfort zone. (Except for Java and .NET, nothing personal)
            </p>
